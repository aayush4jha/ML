# Loan Default Analysis - EDA Project

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focused on understanding the factors that influence loan default behavior using a real-world dataset. The goal is to analyze data and extract insights that can help financial institutions assess credit risk more effectively.

## 📌 Objective

The objective of this EDA is to:
- Understand the characteristics of loan defaulters.
- Identify patterns and relationships among variables that may contribute to default.
- Derive actionable insights to assist in risk analytics for banking and financial services.

## 🗃 Dataset Description

The dataset used in this analysis contains various details related to loans, including:
- Loan amount
- Interest rate
- Term
- Grade and sub-grade
- Employment length
- Home ownership
- Annual income
- Loan purpose
- Address, state
- DTI (debt-to-income ratio)
- Delinquency information
- Loan status (target variable)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Analyses Performed

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Univariate and bivariate analysis
- Missing value treatment
- Outlier detection and removal
- Feature transformation and encoding
- Visualizations to uncover patterns

## 📈 Visualizations

The analysis includes visualizations such as:
- Distribution plots
- Count plots
- Box plots
- Heatmaps (correlation)
- Bar charts grouped by loan status and other features

## 📍 Insights Derived

- Certain grades and sub-grades have higher default rates.
- High interest rates and loan amounts are often associated with defaults.
- Certain loan purposes, like small business loans, tend to show higher risk.
- Home ownership and employment length have some impact on loan repayment behavior.
- Default risk increases with a rise in DTI ratio.

## 💡 Business Implications

The analysis helps identify key borrower characteristics and loan features that influence default. This can assist financial institutions in:
- Enhancing their credit scoring models.
- Adjusting interest rates and loan terms.
- Reducing financial risk through better loan disbursement strategies.
