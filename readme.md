# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Practice Repository

This repository contains a structured collection of machine learning modules and problem statement implementations. The objective is to systematically apply ML concepts through code â€” covering preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretability.

## ðŸ“Ž Notes

- Notebooks are organized by topic or algorithm type.
- Each module is self-contained and focuses on a specific machine learning concept.
- Datasets used are either open-source or linked directly in the notebooks.
